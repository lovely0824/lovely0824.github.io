        <h1>Educate and Entertain</h1>
        <h2>Ted Talks</h2>
        
        <h3>The Art of Misdirection | Apollo Robbins</h3>
        <p>This is one of my favorite Ted Talks because it so interesting. Not only does he mess with the thoughts of what you think you know and where you think your attention is, but he also moves things around so fast. I especially love showing this to people who have never seen it before and see how they react to it. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

        <h3>Why write? Penmanship for the 21st Century | Jake Weidmann</h3>
        <p>This is a Ted Talk about writing and the importance of writing things down, instead of simply typing them. Calligraphy is something very interesting to me because I find it facinating to see the beauty and gracefulness in the curves of letters. I hope that you enjoy this video, and learn something about the importance of the pen.</p>

        <h3>The Power of Vulnerability | Bren√© Brown</h3>
        <p>This is a Ted Talk talks about being vulnerable and why it is so important to embrace this notion. Everyone feels nervous about things and feel as though they are not the right person for the job, this video talks about why this is such an important thing. I hope that you enjoy this video.</p>

        <h3>The Skill of Humor | Andrew Tarvin</h3>
        <p>This is a Ted Talk talks about humor and how it is something that transcends most barriers and shows how people, who most believe cannot use humor, can be funny. I hope that you enjoy this video.</p>
