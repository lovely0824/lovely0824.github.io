        <h1>Educate and Entertain</h1>
        <h2>Ted Talks</h2>
        <h3>The Art of Misdirection | Apollo Robbins</h3>
        <p>This is one of my favorite Ted Talks because it so interesting. Not only does he mess with the thoughts of what you think you know and where you think your attention is, but he also moves things around so fast. I especially love showing this to people who have never seen it before and see how they react to it. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
