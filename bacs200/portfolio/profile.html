        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Ashley Lovely and I am in my fourth year as a student at the University of Norhtern Colorado in Greeley, CO. I am a
            double major in Graphic Design and Marketing. I am also a memeber of the University's Honors Interdisciplinary Program and the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS). I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2021 and hope to start a career as a photographer. I have always loved capturing the moment and making each day worth living. Therefore, I want to take my passions and make a career out of them by capturing a moment in life for others. I also hope to have graphic design as a freelance job, where I can work on posters or album covers.</p>
