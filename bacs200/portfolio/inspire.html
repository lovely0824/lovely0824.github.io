        <p>Layne Staley is a hero in my mind for so many reasons. He has been seen as many things, from musician to heroin addict. However, it is what he did and the things that he said that makes him a hero.</p>
        <p>Here is a list as to why Layne Staley is a hero.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Father left at a young age, yet he managed to bring himself together and make a life.</li>
            <li>Got together with multiple artists to create many bands, all with diferent styles to show his diversity.</li>
            <li>Became the lead singer and cowriter of one of the most famous bands in the world - Alice in Chains.</li>
            <li>He spent his life depressed but decided to never let that consume him and thought only of his fans and other band members, therefore he pushed forward and continued to try to make others happy.</li>
            <li>Although he fell into the path of drugs he was quoted as saying "I'm not sharing with you because I don't want you to get involved in this" showing how he knew drugs were bad, they just had too much of a hold on him.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Layne Staley has been an inspiration for many people through his music, particularly his lyrics. They are filled with so much emotion and thought that it causes the audience to capture what he was truly going through. However, his life story is what will be the most inspiring part his the man for me.</p>
