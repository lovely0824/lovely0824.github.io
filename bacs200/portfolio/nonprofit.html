        <p>IRCNOCO stands for Immigrant Refugee Center of Northern Colorado adn is an organization located in the University of Northern Colorado.</p>
        
        <p>They are focused on creating a better place for those who have traveled here in hopes of a new start. They work with people to help them learn English, get a job, learn new skills, become a citizen, and even financial problems. They allow multiple oppurtnities to get people the help that they need, and even reach out to people on campus to see if they have a need to help others and get them involved in their program.</p>
        
        <p>This is a group that has made a significant impact on me recently. I am currently taking a MIND class called Ideas in Conflict, where we read a book about immigration and moving to America. We then had people from this group come in and talk to us. This included some of the leaders of the organizaion as well as students that work there. The students shared their personal stories of moving here and the struggles that they faced. These were the most impactful parts of the presentation to me because they were real and had emotion in them that reached out to someone like me who never had an idea of the struggle it would be to leave your home.</p>
        

            <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
        
        <p>Creating a Better Life for Struggling People.</p>
        
            <h2>Compelling Vision</h2>
        
        <p>Making connections with people that have left everything behind so that they feel welcome. Then taking these connections and providing help with the next steps of beginning their new life. The main goal is to be there for people and provide whatever they need because they have struggled enough with this change.</p>

            <h3>Strategies</h3>
        
        <p>1. Creating connections and making a statement to people in a broader audience. This includes marketing through social media and digital marketing to reach more people to know that they can get help.</p>
        
        <p>2. Get more student involvement. This is the time that students are figuring out who they are and what they want to do. Reaching out to thema and seeing fi they would be willing to help can expand their network.</p>
        
        <p>3. Getting out into the community to share their stories and tell what they do. Getting in contact with people and giving a face to the organization is important to show others what options there are out there.</p>
