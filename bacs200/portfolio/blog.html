            <h1>The Art of Being an Artist in a Business World</h1>
            <h2>by Ashley A. Lovely</h2>
        </div>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Art has been an ever-changing layout with multiple meanings, from paintings of people to handmade pots and mugs. Now we are in the era of digital marketing and creating art such as logos or illustrations all online. Even with all of these changes and innovations, art is still seen as something lower than the incredible skill it is.</p>
        
        <p>With the increased use of social media, we are able to share creations with people all over the world and continue to be inspired by seeing what others can do. Having tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator have increased the ability to make art through the use of technology. Multiple tutorials exist to help people find their creativity and begin their artistic journey.</p>
        
        <p>However, the skill of art (designing, painting, drawing, music, etc.) is seen as extracurricular, not something to excel at and make a career out of. Saying you are an artist immediately gives people the image that you struggle from day to day, instead of having a prosperous life, but that should not be the case.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the creation of ideas.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the driver of change.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the definition of innovation.</p>
        
        <p>
            <h2>Why is Business Called the Leader of the World?</h2>
            
        <p> Business is one of the most respected degrees to obtain. These people are seen as those who are leaders and knowledgeable about the world.</p>
        
        <p>
            <h3>1. Importance of Business</h3>
        
        <p>Business is, without a doubt, an initiator of progression. Without those in the business world, life would not be able to move forward. These are the people that determine the best ways to manage money, drive a business forward to becoming something globally loved, reach more customers around the world and making connections to name a few.</p>
        
        <p>Business leaders are the reason companies like Apple, Google and Coca-Cola are known throughout the world. These are household names in every country and have made a place for themselves in the world through the use of business.</p>
        
        <p>Most people go to someone that is trained to help with their taxes.</p>
        
        <p>Most people trust a product with a well-known brand name without second guessing.</p>
        
        <p>Why? Why do you trust brands? Why do you know companies?</p>
        
        <p>Business.</p>
        
        <p>These are the people that have learned how to market themselves and create a niche that allows them to grow. They have learned the way to capture people’s attention and found a way to reach the right people to grow and continue to reach a broader audience.</p>
        
        <p>
            <h3>2. Recognition</h3>
        
        <p>There are multiple divisions of business: Marketing, Finance, Accounting, Management, etc. Each of these have their own important functions and are individually responsible for holding a company above water.</p>
        
        <p>These are very well-known divisions and are self-explanatory as to the function that they serve. Telling someone that you are a marketer is simple and people understand what you do at your job. It’s true that all of these divisions have sub-divisions within them. However, those are also known and understood for what they are and how they function.</p>
        
        <p>Business is universal, even with all of the divisions.</p>
        
        <p>More than that, saying you are part of the business world makes you more credible. You are seen as successful and responsible because of the direction that you chose to take. You went for a business degree and are able to sustain a good living and take care of yourself.</p>
        
        <p>Business = Respect</p>
        
        <p>
            <h2>Why is Art Looked Down Upon?</h2>
        
        <p>Most people see art as a hobby or something that you do on your free time, not a career.</p>
        
        <p>
            <h3>1. Small Niche of People are Successful</h3>
        
        <p>Art can be defined by many things, however each of these only have few people that are truly successful and known for their talent. This includes, graphic designers, musicians, writers, painters, etc. Everyone knows the name Vincent Van Gogh for painting Starry Night, or Eminem for The Real Slim Shady. You know Alfred Hitchcock for his vision in Psycho and Steven Spielberg for his emotional story of Schindler’s List.</p>
        
        <p>These are all artists.</p>
        
        <p>People hear someone is an artist and have such a small idea of the possibilities that can come from that statement. More “artists” are successful than memory will allow people to admit because of the diversity that art allows there to be.</p>
        
        <p>
            <h3>2. “The Struggling Artist”</h3>
        
        <p>This is such a common statement that everyone has heard it. Artists are constantly struggling, whether to find work, be recognized, or simply do day-to-day tasks like paying bills. The thought of artists always results to the same image of someone on the street selling art for around $20 just to buy lunch.</p>
        
        <p>This is not the case.</p>
        
        <p>Art is so much more than painting a pretty picture or drawing random people on the subway. Creativity is all around people, and for the most part it is taken advantage of.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the CGI seen in movies such as The Avengers and Interstellar.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the videogames young teenagers are playing in the rooms from dusk till dawn.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the app you use to book your next vacation or fall asleep.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the family portrait on a wall.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the cover of an album from your favorite band or artists.</p>
        
        <p>Art is every logo you can recognize by just the top 1/3, like Lays and the Coca-Cola script.</p>
        
        <p>Art is your memory.</p>
        
        <p>You are inspired to buy products, join a group, or use a website simply because of your interaction with it. The most interesting art is the one that you remember. Not because you saw it, but because you were able to make a connection to it.</p>
        
        <p>Most people don’t understand how important “the struggling artists” truly is. They don’t know that these are the people that create the vision we have of products and movies. These are the people that design our favorite games and draw characters in the books children read day after day.</p>
        
        <p>
            <h2>The Take-Away</h2>
        
        <p>Business is one of the most important functions in society. This is how we are able to grow and expand, both our connection and our knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>Art is the creativity behind growth. Without the visions of those who design, we would not be able to capture the ideas that business leaders have to drive us forward.</p>
        
        <p>And so it goes that being an artist in a business world is just as important as being a businessman in an art world.</p>
